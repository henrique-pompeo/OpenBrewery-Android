### Brewery List

![Open Brewery List Image](./docs/images/open-brewery-list.png)

The results shown at brewery list is gotten from https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries 
through GET HTTP request. This API returns a brewery list in a JSON array and the application is 
responsible for converting the data into a readable one. Example:

```json

## Architecture

The architecture used in this project is MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with Clean Architecture 
principles.

### Presentation layer

The presentation layer is responsible for displaying the data to the user and handling user 
interactions.

#### Activity and Fragment

The Activity and Fragments are responsible for handling the UI and user interactions.

#### Adapter and ViewHolder

The Adapter and ViewHolder are responsible for handling with the RecyclerView and its items.

#### ViewModel

The ViewModel is responsible for handling the UI-related data. It provides data to the UI and acts 
as a communication center between the Repository and the UI. The ViewModel is part of the lifecycle 
library and it is lifecycle-aware, meaning it can be notified of lifecycle changes.

### Domain layer

The domain layer is responsible for handling the business logic of the application.

#### Model

The Model is responsible for handling the data.

#### Mappers

The Mappers are responsible for handling the data conversion.

#### UseCase

The UseCase is responsible for executing any use case in the application. It is the bridge between 
the presentation layer and the data layer.

#### Interfaces

The Interfaces are responsible for handling the communication between the domain layer and the data

### Data layer (Datasource)

The data layer is responsible for handling the data operations of the application.

#### DataProvider

The DataProvider is responsible for handling the data operations. In this project, it handles with 
local data using Room library.

##### Configuration

The configuration is responsible for handling the database configuration.

##### DAO

The DAO is responsible for handling the database operations.

##### Entity

The Entity is responsible for handling the database entities.

#### DataSource

The DataSource is responsible for handling the data operations. In this project, it handles with 
remote data using Retrofit library.

##### Repository

The Repository is responsible for handling the data operations. It is the bridge between the domain 
and data layers.

## Dependency Injection

The dependency injection is done using Koin, a lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin

### Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer is responsible for handling the dependency injection of the application.
You can see infrastructure layers in whole project.

## Navigation

The navigation is done using the Jetpack Navigation library.

Home -> Brewery List -> Brewery Details

## Tests

In this project with implemented Unit Test. The tests are done using JUnit, Mockk, Kotlintest 
Assertions, and Coroutines Test.
